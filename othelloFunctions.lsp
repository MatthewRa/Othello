Author: Steve Huerta, Matthew Rames
Written Spring 2016 for CSC447/547 AI class.

This file contains functions for an othello game. Such as player moves and computer AI moves.
The AI uses mini-max with alpha beta pruning to determine the best moves based on a 4ply depth.
This file also contains methods for scoring a board, fliping, placing pieces on a board, and 
generating successors of a board state.
